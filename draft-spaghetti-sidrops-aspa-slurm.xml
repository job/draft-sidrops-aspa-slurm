  <section title="SLURM v2 File Overview">
    <t>
      A SLURM file consists of a single JSON object containing the following members:
    </t>
    <ul>
      <li>A "slurmVersion" member that MUST be set to 2, encoded as a number</li>
      <li>
        A "validationOutputFilters" member whose value is an object.
        The object MUST contain exactly three members:
        <ul>
          <li>A "prefixFilters" member, see Section 3.3.1 <xref target="RFC8416"/></li>
          <li>A "bgpsecFilters" member, see section 3.3.2 <xref target="RFC8416"/></li>
          <li>A "aspaFilters" member, see <xref target="aspaFilters"/></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        A "locallyAddedAssertions" member whose value is an object.
        The object MUST contain exactly three members:
        <ul>
          <li>A "prefixAssertions" member, see Section 3.4.1 <xref target="RFC8416"/></li>
          <li>A "bgpsecAssertions" member, see Section 3.4.2 <xref target="RFC8416"/></li>
          <li>A "aspaAssertions" member, see <xref target="aspaAssertions"/></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

      The following JSON structure with JSON members represents a SLURM file that has no filters or assertions:

  <section title="Validation Output Filters for ASPA">

    <section title="Validated ASPA Filters" anchor="aspaFilters">
      <t>
        The RP can configure zero or more Validated ASPA Filters ("ASPA Filters" for short.
        Each ASPA Filter can contain a single 'customer_asid' and optionally a single 'comment'.
        The 'customer_asid' member has as value a number.
        It is RECOMMENDED that an explanatory comment is included with each ASPA Filter so that it can be shown to users of the RP software.

  <section title="Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION">
    <t>
      This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
      The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
      Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
      Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
      This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
      Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.
    </t>

    <t>
      According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
      It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".
